# IoT_Emulator_GUI


This desktop application was created as part of my Senior Capstone Project.
Programming against an IoT Device can be difficult in a dsitributed setting.

This software allows developers to progam against an emulated IoT device, enabling them to test their code without requiring
physical access to the device itself.


This software was completley written in python3 using PyQt and custom stylesheets.

Clone the repository and install required dependencies.
